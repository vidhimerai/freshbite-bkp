Steps to run the project

1. The project does not have node modules, hence those needs to installed in both the 'frontend' and 'server' folder. 
Open terminal in frontend folder and server folder -> Run 'npm i' command in both the terminals.
2. In the 'server' terminal, run 'node index.js' command.
3. In the 'frontend' terminal, run 'npm run dev' command. The terminal gives a link to the localhost, click on the link to access the website.
